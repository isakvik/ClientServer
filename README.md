Client/server program written in C++ using SFML for socket/packet handling. Pretty simple system and structure, but demonstrates a NAT punchthrough system that makes connecting to others more robust.

See the [NAT Punchthrough Server](https://github.com/isakvik/NAT-Punchthrough-Server) repo for the central server used for this experiment.
